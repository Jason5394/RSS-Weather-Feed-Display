# RSS-Weather-Feed-Display
A GUI to display RSS weather feed data made in Python

Displays weather information based on the corresponding weather RSS feed, which can be found at http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/,
 from the NOAA's National Weather Service.  All data and img src's found in this app can be found at the above url.

 This project uses the tkinter library for development of the gui, and feedparser 5.2.1 to parse the rss feeds.
